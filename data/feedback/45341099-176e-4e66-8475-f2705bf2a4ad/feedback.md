# Resume Feedback for Software Engineer Position at Amazon

## Overall Assessment
This is a strong resume for a Software Engineer internship at Amazon. It demonstrates relevant technical skills, impressive projects, and valuable professional experience. However, there are areas where the resume could be further optimized to better align with the target position and stand out to recruiters.

## Strengths
1. Diverse technical skillset including Python, Java, C++, SQL, and various tools/technologies
2. Relevant professional experience at well-known companies like AWS and MagicLabs
3. Impressive projects that showcase technical abilities and problem-solving skills
4. Strong academic background with relevant coursework and high GPA from a prestigious university

## Areas for Improvement
1. Resume is quite lengthy and could be more concise, especially for an internship position
2. Some bullet points are too long and could be more focused on key achievements/impact
3. Certain experiences (e.g. Change.org) seem less relevant for a software engineering role
4. Skills section could be better organized and prioritized based on relevance to the position
5. Missing a strong opening summary statement to grab the reader's attention

## Content & Structure
The resume is well-structured with clear sections for education, professional experience, projects, and skills. However, the overall length is a bit excessive for an internship resume. Consider trimming down some of the less relevant experiences and focusing on the most impactful bullet points. The projects section is a strength and effectively showcases technical skills. Consider adding some whitespace between sections to improve readability.

## Impact & Achievement Focus
Most bullet points effectively demonstrate achievements and impact, especially in the professional experience section. Quantifying results with metrics is a great approach (e.g. "increased overall model transition detection by 2.7%"). However, some bullets could still be more concise and focused on the key takeaways. For example, the Change.org bullets could emphasize the specific impact of your work on the platform and users.

## ATS Optimization
The resume includes many relevant keywords for a software engineering role, such as specific programming languages, tools, and technologies. However, it could benefit from including a few more Amazon-specific keywords like "leadership principles", "customer obsession", "ownership", etc. Additionally, consider tweaking the skills section to better match the terminology in the job description.

## Specific Recommendations
1. Add a concise opening summary statement that highlights your top qualifications and career goals
2. Trim down the resume to 1-1.5 pages by removing less relevant experiences and being more concise
3. Focus bullet points on key achievements and impact, using metrics wherever possible
4. Reorganize the skills section to prioritize the most relevant skills for the position
5. Include a few Amazon-specific keywords and phrases to better tailor the resume
6. Add some whitespace between sections to improve visual appeal and readability
7. Consider removing the Ethics Bowl from Awards, as it seems less directly relevant for the role

Overall, this is a strong resume with impressive experiences and skills. By making it more concise, focused, and tailored to the specific position at Amazon, you'll improve your chances of standing out and landing an interview. Best of luck!

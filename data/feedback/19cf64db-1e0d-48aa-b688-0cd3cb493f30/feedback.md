Thank you for the resume review request. Unfortunately, it looks like there was an issue processing the PDF file with the resume content. Without being able to review the actual resume, I'm unable to provide specific, personalized feedback as you requested.

When you have a chance, please try uploading the resume content again, either directly pasted into the chat or as a different file type like a Word doc or plain text file. I'd be happy to review the full resume in detail and provide comprehensive feedback to help improve its effectiveness for the entry-level Software Engineer position at Google.

Some general tips I can offer in the meantime:

- Tailor the resume content to the specific requirements listed in the job description 
- Highlight relevant projects, skills and coursework for a software engineering role
- Quantify impact and results from past experiences wherever possible
- Keep the formatting clean, consistent and easy to scan quickly
- Include relevant keywords that may be used in applicant tracking systems
- Limit the length to 1 page for an entry-level position

Please feel free to submit the resume again when you're able to. I look forward to reviewing it and providing more targeted, actionable feedback to strengthen your application. Let me know if you have any other questions!
